## Our Experience at IBA Probattle '25
Recently, [Fakhurddin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fakhurddin-junejo/) and I participated in IBA Probattle '25, organized by [IBA Computer Science Society,](https://www.linkedin.com/company/iba-computer-science-society/posts/?feedView=all&viewAsMember=true) where we took on the challenge of the Business Intelligence (BI) module. It was an amazing experience full of learning, excitement, and challenges. We were given a complex dataset and had to create an interactive dashboard using Power BI. After putting in hours of effort, we were thrilled to secure the position of runners-up!

## The Dataset We Worked With
We were given a dataset from the [Turkish Market Sales Dataset with 9000items](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omercolakoglu/turkish-market-sales-dataset-with-9000items/data), which included:

- 50,000+ Customers – Giving us insights into different customer behaviors and demographics.
- 9,000+ Items – A wide variety of products categorized under different brands.
- 81 Stores – Sales data from stores across various cities, allowing us to explore regional trends.

Our task was to analyze this data and present meaningful insights through an interactive dashboard.

## Our Approach
To make the most of the limited time we had, we followed a well-structured approach:

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

We started by cleaning the data to remove errors and inconsistencies.
Organizing the data properly helped us get accurate insights later on.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

We explored the data to understand sales patterns, customer demographics, and product performance.
This helped us decide on the key metrics and visuals to include in our dashboard

## Building the Dashboard
### We used Power BI to design a dashboard that showcased:
- Sales and Profit Overview – To track revenue and profit trends.
- Customer Demographics – Analyzing sales by gender.
- Top Performing Stores – Highlighting the most profitable locations.
- Geographical Insights – Visualizing profit distribution across different cities.
