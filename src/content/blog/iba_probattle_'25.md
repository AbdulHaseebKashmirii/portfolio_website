## Our Experience at IBA Probattle '25
Recently, Fakhurddin and I participated in IBA Probattle '25, where we took on the challenge of the Business Intelligence (BI) module. It was an incredible experience, filled with learning, excitement, and a fair share of challenges. We had to analyze a complex dataset and create an interactive dashboard using Power BI. After putting in hours of hard work, we were thrilled to secure the position of runners-up!

The Dataset We Worked With
We were given the Turkish Market Sales Dataset, which was massive and full of valuable information:

50,000+ Customers â€“ Giving us insights into different customer behaviors and demographics.
9,000+ Items â€“ A wide variety of products categorized under different brands.
81 Stores â€“ Sales data from stores across various cities, allowing us to explore regional trends.
The dataset was detailed and complex, but we knew that by analyzing it effectively, we could uncover meaningful insights.

Our Approach
To make the most of the limited time we had, we followed a well-structured approach:

Data Cleaning and Preparation

We started by cleaning the data to remove errors and inconsistencies.
Organizing the data properly helped us get accurate insights later on.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

We explored the data to understand sales patterns, customer demographics, and product performance.
This helped us decide on the key metrics and visuals to include in our dashboard.
Building the Dashboard in Power BI

We designed an interactive dashboard that included:
Sales and Profit Overview â€“ To track revenue and profit trends.
Top Performing Stores â€“ Highlighting the most profitable locations.
Customer Demographics â€“ Analyzing sales by gender and age groups.
Geographical Insights â€“ Using map visuals to show profit distribution by city.
Providing Business Recommendations

Based on our analysis, we suggested actionable strategies to improve sales and profitability.
Challenges We Faced
The competition wasnâ€™t without its challenges:

Complex Data: The dataset was huge, and cleaning it was time-consuming.
Choosing the Right Visuals: We wanted to make the dashboard informative yet easy to understand.
Time Constraint: We had 4 hours for analysis and dashboard creation, followed by 1 hour for evaluation. It was a race against time!
Presentation and Results
During the evaluation, the judges appreciated our interactive dashboard and the actionable business recommendations we provided. When they announced that we were the runners-up, we were overjoyed! It was an incredible feeling to see our hard work pay off.

What We Learned
This experience taught us a lot:

Effective Teamwork â€“ Collaborating efficiently helped us overcome challenges.
Power BI Skills â€“ We enhanced our skills in data visualization and dashboard design.
Connecting Insights with Actions â€“ We learned how to link data insights with real-world business decisions.
Final Thoughts
Participating in IBA Probattle '25 was an unforgettable experience. It wasnâ€™t just about winning but about learning, growing, and challenging ourselves. Ending up as runners-up was a proud moment for us, but the knowledge and experience we gained were even more valuable.

Looking back, weâ€™re grateful for the journey and the memories we made. Would we participate again? Absolutely!

> Important!!! Forestry is going to be discontinued on April 22nd, 2023. You can [read their announcement](https://forestry.io/blog/forestry.io-end-of-life/) for more info.

In this article, I will explain step by step process of connecting AstroPaper theme with the Forestry headless CMS. So, let's get started ðŸŽ‰



## What is Forestry?

[Forestry](https://forestry.io/ "Forestry Website") is a git-based headless CMS and we can manage our markdown contents easily by using that. Although it is not an open-sourced CMS, it has a good free plan by which we can import up to 3 sites (3 repositories). In this article, I'll demonstrate how we can use Forestry as git-based CMS of our AstroPaper blog theme.

## Login / Register an account at Forestry.io

First of all, you have to create an account at [Forestry website](https://app.forestry.io/login "Forestry Login Page"). I usually sign up with my Github account.

## Import AstroPaper site (repository)

This part is importing the repository to Forestry and a little bit of set up process.

### Add Site

After logging in/signing up an account, import your AstroPaper site by clicking "Add Site" button.
