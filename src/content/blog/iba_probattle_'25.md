## Our Experience at IBA Probattle '25
Recently, [Fakhurddin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fakhurddin-junejo/) and I participated in IBA Probattle '25, organized by [IBA Computer Science Society,](https://www.linkedin.com/company/iba-computer-science-society/posts/?feedView=all&viewAsMember=true) where we took on the challenge of the Business Intelligence (BI) module. It was an amazing experience full of learning, excitement, and challenges. We were given a complex dataset and had to create an interactive dashboard using Power BI. After putting in hours of effort, we were thrilled to secure the position of runners-up!

## The Dataset We Worked With
We were given a dataset from the [Turkish Market Sales Dataset with 9000items](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omercolakoglu/turkish-market-sales-dataset-with-9000items/data), which included:

- 50,000+ Customers â€“ Giving us insights into different customer behaviors and demographics.
- 9,000+ Items â€“ A wide variety of products categorized under different brands.
- 81 Stores â€“ Sales data from stores across various cities, allowing us to explore regional trends.

Our task was to analyze this data and present meaningful insights through an interactive dashboard.

## Our Approach
To make the most of the limited time we had, we followed a well-structured approach:

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

We started by cleaning the data to remove errors and inconsistencies.
Organizing the data properly helped us get accurate insights later on.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

We explored the data to understand sales patterns, customer demographics, and product performance.
This helped us decide on the key metrics and visuals to include in our dashboard

## Building the Dashboard
### We used Power BI to design a dashboard that showcased:
- Sales and Profit Overview â€“ To track revenue and profit trends.
- Customer Demographics â€“ Analyzing sales by gender.
- Top Performing Stores â€“ Highlighting the most profitable locations.
- Geographical Insights â€“ Visualizing profit distribution across different cities.

Our interactive dashboard, showcasing key sales trends and insights.

Complex Data: The dataset was huge, and cleaning it was time-consuming.
Choosing the Right Visuals: We wanted to make the dashboard informative yet easy to understand.
Time Constraint: We had 4 hours for analysis and dashboard creation, followed by 1 hour for evaluation. It was a race against time!
Presentation and Results
During the evaluation, the judges appreciated our interactive dashboard and the actionable business recommendations we provided. When they announced that we were the runners-up, we were overjoyed! It was an incredible feeling to see our hard work pay off.

What We Learned
This experience taught us a lot:

Effective Teamwork â€“ Collaborating efficiently helped us overcome challenges.
Power BI Skills â€“ We enhanced our skills in data visualization and dashboard design.
Connecting Insights with Actions â€“ We learned how to link data insights with real-world business decisions.
Final Thoughts
Participating in IBA Probattle '25 was an unforgettable experience. It wasnâ€™t just about winning but about learning, growing, and challenging ourselves. Ending up as runners-up was a proud moment for us, but the knowledge and experience we gained were even more valuable.

Looking back, weâ€™re grateful for the journey and the memories we made. Would we participate again? Absolutely!

> Important!!! Forestry is going to be discontinued on April 22nd, 2023. You can [read their announcement](https://forestry.io/blog/forestry.io-end-of-life/) for more info.

In this article, I will explain step by step process of connecting AstroPaper theme with the Forestry headless CMS. So, let's get started ðŸŽ‰



## What is Forestry?

[Forestry](https://forestry.io/ "Forestry Website") is a git-based headless CMS and we can manage our markdown contents easily by using that. Although it is not an open-sourced CMS, it has a good free plan by which we can import up to 3 sites (3 repositories). In this article, I'll demonstrate how we can use Forestry as git-based CMS of our AstroPaper blog theme.

## Login / Register an account at Forestry.io

First of all, you have to create an account at [Forestry website](https://app.forestry.io/login "Forestry Login Page"). I usually sign up with my Github account.

## Import AstroPaper site (repository)

This part is importing the repository to Forestry and a little bit of set up process.

### Add Site

After logging in/signing up an account, import your AstroPaper site by clicking "Add Site" button.
