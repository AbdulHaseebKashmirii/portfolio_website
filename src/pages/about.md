I am an undergraduate business analytics student passionate about technology and its ability to drive meaningful change.

Currently, I am in my 2nd year at FAST NUCES Karachi, working toward a bachelor’s degree in business analytics.

When I’m not studying, I enjoy improving my programming skills and exploring data analysis and machine learning. I love experimenting with tools like SQL, Python, Excel, and Power BI to turn data into meaningful insights. Along the way, I also document my learnings and experiences. If you’re curious, feel free to check out [my writing](https://www.ahaseeb.com/posts/)!
