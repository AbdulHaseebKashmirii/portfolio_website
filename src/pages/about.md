I am an undergraduate business analysit student passionate about technology and its ability to drive meaningful change.

Currently, I am in my junior year at FAST NUCES Karachi, working toward a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science.

In my free time, I focus on developing my programming skills and exploring data analysis and machine learning. I love diving into projects that allow me to use tools like SQL, Python,Excel and Power BI to visualize and manage data, telling stories and uncovering insights.

Feel free to connect with me on social media or drop me an <a href="mailto:abdulhaseeb5654@gmail.com" class="button">email</a>—I’d love to hear from you!
