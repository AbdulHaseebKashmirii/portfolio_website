I am an undergraduate computer science student passionate about technology and its ability to drive meaningful change.

Currently, I’m in my junior (3rd) year at FAST NUCES Karachi pursuing a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science.

In my free time, I focus on developing my programming skills and exploring data analysis and machine learning. I love diving into projects that allow me to use tools like SQL, Python,Excel and Power BI to visualize and manage data, telling stories and uncovering insights.
