I am an undergraduate business analytics student passionate about technology and its ability to drive meaningful change.

Currently, I am in my 2nd year at FAST NUCES Karachi, working toward a bachelor’s degree in business analytics.

When I’m not working, I enjoy improving my programming skills and diving into data analysis and machine learning. I love experimenting with tools like SQL, Python, Excel, and Power BI to turn data into meaningful insights.

Feel free to reach out on social media or send me an <a href="mailto:abdulhaseeb5654@gmail.com" class="button">email</a>—I’m always open to connecting and having a good conversation!
